# UFOs

## Overview of Project
For this project, we were assigned to create a HTML webpage to display and filter data within a JavaScript datafile that includes data on UFO sightings in from 1/1/2010 to 1/13/2010. In order to filter data based on date, city, state, country and shape, we created 5 filters.  
## Results

When you navigate to the webpage, the first thing you see is above. We have our webpage title and an article quote.

When you scroll down, you have the filter criteria where you can enter different filters.

Next to the filters, you have the table containing all the data.

If we want to narrow down this data, we just have to type in the search criteria. Here, I filtered the data by date being "1/10/2010" and shape being "sphere."

Once those filters are entered, the table updates to include only that data that includes our filters. 

## Summary
With this design, we are able to filter by date, city, state, country and shape. One draw back to this design is that the data we have is for 1/1/2010 through 1/13/2010 and the design is specific around only having that limited amount of data. One recommendation for further development is to have our webpage connected to a source and updating daily with new UFO sighting data. A second recommendation for further development is to have a "year" filter button, "month" filter button and "day" filter button should our data set grow to include multiple years, and possibly multiple decades.
